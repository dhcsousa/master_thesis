## Sensor Qualification In An Industrial Environment Using A Convolutional Neural Network
Nowadays, sensors occupy a significant role in our everyday lives. Magnetoresistive sensors have been proven to be very useful in many applications, from sensing magnetic fields to precision encoding. As a consequence, there is a constant demand to optimize such devices and maximize their production yield.
In any nano/microfabrication process, time is one of the most valuable resources. It is crucial to have tools to evaluate rapidly if the produced structures are within the expected outcomes or not.
This work presents a tool for quantitative analysis of some critical parameters of Magnetoresistive Devices fabrication. Furthermore, the software includes an automatic curve classifier using a Convolutional Neural Network to qualify Magnetoresistive Devices, focusing on sensors. Alongside the software for quantitative analysis and the curve classifier for sensors, it is also briefly discussed the use of a machine learning-based algorithm to predict the yield of a given nano/microfabrication fabrication process.
