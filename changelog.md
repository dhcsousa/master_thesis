# Changelog
All important changes to the project are documented in this file.
## V1.0
First code version includes SMP processor which returns relevant quantities such as:
- R(H) plots;
- Magnetoresistance value;
- Resistance at the desired field;
- Group multiple SMPs R(H) plots by the index of measurement.
## V2.0
The second version includes SMP processor and data visualizer.
- In addition to the previous functions the data processor also includes:
  - The low plateau resistance value.
  - Open and short circuit threshold for filtering undesired measurements;
  - A SMP progress bar and a function progress bar are now included.
- The data visualizer can plot all the relevant quantities on an interactive plot saved under .HTML format.
## V3.0
The third version includes SMP processor and data visualizer.
- In addition to the previous functions the data processor also includes:
  - Entry fields to input which columns of the SMP files are relevant;
- The data visualizer can plot all the relevant quantities on an interactive plot saved under .HTML format.
